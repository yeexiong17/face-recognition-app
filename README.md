## Project Overview
This website is designed to perform face recognition using a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), while the backend utilizes Node.js. The goal is to provide an efficient and responsive face recognition experience.

## Getting Started

### Frontend
1. Open your terminal and navigate to the `face-recognition` directory:
    ```bash
    cd face-recognition
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
   This will start the Vite development server for the React frontend.

4. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to access the Face Recognition website.

### Backend
1. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `face-recognition-api` directory:
    ```bash
    cd face-recognition-api
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
   This will launch the Node.js backend for the face recognition API.

4. The backend server will be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
